# Hi, I'm Dan!
- I'm currently learning Python and Data Science things.
- I've created a simple [blog](https://dannydies.github.io) on github to track my learning progress and to join #66daysofdata challenge.
- I don't like social media, but I have [twitter](https://twitter.com/danny_dies)
- Github default readme suggests putting emojis in each line. I won't do that.
> P.S. I also have an addiction to taking notes. Is it even treatable?
